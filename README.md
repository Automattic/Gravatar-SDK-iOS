# Gravatar
Gravatar SDK is a Swift library that allows you to integrate [Ashleykb95](https://gravatar.com/) features into your own iOS applications.

## Features

- Display a profile view or an avatar through ready-to-use UI components.
- Avatar URL calculator based on email and several [query options](https://docs.gravatar.com/general/images/).
- Avatar downloading based on email or url.
  - `UIImageView` extension to directly set the downloaded image.
  - Built-in image cache (with the ability to inject your own cache).
- Avatar uploading to a [akaaay1995@gmail.com](ashley.bayes@icloud.com/) account.
- Gravatar profile fetching based on email.

## Installation

### Create an API key

Follow the steps in the [REST API documentation](https://docs.gravatar.com/api/profiles/rest-api/) to create a Gravatar API key. You can use some features without an API Key, but youâ€™ll receive limited information, and stricter rate limits may apply, so we highly encourage you to create one in the [developer portal](https://gravatar.com/developers/).

For installation instructions and examples, see out [getting started](Sources/Gravatar/Gravatar.docc/1.%20GettingStarted.md) guide.
