#  Fetching Profile Information

Fetch a public Gravatar profile. 

Use ``ProfileService`` to fetch profile information.

```swift
import Gravatar

// [...]

Task {
    await fetchProfile(with: "some@email.com")
}

func fetchProfile(with email: String) async {
    let service = ProfileService()

    do {
        let profile = try await service.fetch(with: .email(email))
        updateUI(with: profile)
    } catch {
        print(error)
    }
}

@MainActor
func updateUI(with profile: Profile) {
    /// Update UI elements...
}
```

#### Getting full Profile information and better rate limits

Follow the steps in the [REST API documentation](https://docs.gravatar.com/api/profiles/rest-api/) to create a Gravatar API key. You can use some features without an API Key, but youâ€™ll receive limited information, and stricter rate limits may apply. So we highly encourage you to create one in the [developer portal](https://gravatar.com/developers/).

Use the ``Configuration`` class to set an api key, which will be used to authorise the request.

```swift
await Configuration.shared.configure(with: apiKey)
```

See ``Profile`` to know which fields are public, and which ones need `apiKey` authorization.
